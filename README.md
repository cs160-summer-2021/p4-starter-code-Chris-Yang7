# LearnIt

The goal of this application is to help those who are learning English as their non-primary language. Below are 3 main tasks of the application:

### 1. Unscrambling Words: 
Users are given 9 randomly chosen letters and must construct a valid word from them. When a potential word has been built, the user clicks the “Check” button to verify whether their word is valid. If it is, then the user is navigated to the Definition page. Otherwise, the “Check” button flashes red to indicate an invalid word. 

### 2. Defining Words: 
The app consults an online dictionary and fetches the definition of the word created by the user. It also provides an audio clip that demonstrates the proper pronunciation of the word. Users also have the option to translate everything on the page besides the found word for better understanding and comparison. The discovered word is also stored on the Saved Words page for future reference. 

### 3. Use the Words in a Sentence: 
The user must then construct a sentence that uses their word. They are given two additional words that also must be used in the sentence. Once the user has constructed a sentence, they click the “Check” button so the app can verify whether they satisfied the requirements.
